## The project's name

**Enceladus** (/ɛnˈsɛlədəs/; Greek: Εγκέλαδος) is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. 

It is about 500 kilometers (310 mi) in diameter, about a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Solar System. 

Consequently, its surface temperature at noon only reaches −198 °C (−324 °F), far colder than a light-absorbing body 
would be.

Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide range of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to 
young, tectonically deformed terrains.

Enceladus was discovered on August 28, 1789, by William Herschel, but little was known about it until the two Voyager 
spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, passed nearby in 1980 and 1981.

In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in 
greater detail.

In particular, Cassini discovered water-rich plumes venting from the south polar region.

Cryovolcanoes near the South Pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, molecular hydrogen, other volatiles, and 
solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling about 200 kg (440 lb) per
second.

Over 100 geysers have been identified.

Some water vapor falls back as "snow"; the rest escapes, and supplies most of the material making up Saturn's 
E ring.

According to NASA scientists, the plumes are similar in composition to comets.

In 2014, NASA reported that Cassini found evidence for a large south polar subsurface ocean of liquid water with a 
thickness of around 10 km (6 mi).

These geyser observations, along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in 
the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. 

Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance.

Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its 
interior and driving the geological activity.

On June 27, 2018, scientists reported the detection of complex macromolecular organics on Enceladus's jet plumes, as
sampled by the Cassini orbiter.

These indicate potential hydrothermal activity on the moon driving complex chemistry.
